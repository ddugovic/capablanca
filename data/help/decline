decline

Usage: decline [1-n, all, abort, adjourn, draw, match, pause, player, simul,
switch, takeback]

  Decline an offer that has been made to you.  If no parameter is given and
there is only one offer, you decline it.  If there is more than one offer (for
example multiple match offers), then you must specify which offer you want to
decline.  You can decline offers in several ways: by number, by type, all
offers, or by the player's name making the offer.  For example, the command
"decline match" will decline all pending match offers you have been given. 
The command "decline Shane" will decline the offer made by Shane.
