accept

Usage: accept [1-n, all, abort, adjourn, draw, match, pause, player, simul,
switch, takeback]

  Accepts an offer that has been made to you.  If no parameter is given and
there is only one offer, you accept it.  If there is more than one offer
pending (for example, multiple match offers) you will shown a list of pening
offers and asked which one to accept.  Then you must specify which offer to
accept.  You can either choose the offer by number, or by type (such as draw,
adjourn, abort, or takeback).  "All" accepts all pending offers.

See Also:  decline  pending  match  draw  adjourn  abort  takeback
