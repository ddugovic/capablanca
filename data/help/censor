censor

Usage: +|-|= censor [user]

  When a player is on your censor list, you will not hear anything from
him/her when he/she tells, shouts, matches, kibitzes, whispers and says.  When
users on your censor list send you a direct message using "tell", they will be
notified of their being on your censor list.  Here are the variations of the
command possible:

    +censor user     Add "user" to censor list
    -censor user     Remove "user" from censor list
    =censor          Display your censor list

  Note that "noplay" only filters match requests, not other communications.
