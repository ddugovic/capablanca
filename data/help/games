games

Usage: games [#, word]

  If no parameters are given, "games" lists all the games currently being
played on the server.  The games are listed in order of the ratings of the
players involved.  If a number is supplied as a parameter, only the game
matching that number is displayed.  If a word (or even a single letter) is
supplied, only games involving players whose handles begin with that word are
displayed.  For example, "games gr" will show all games involving players
whose handles begin with "gr".

  Here is a sample games display and what the symbols mean:
