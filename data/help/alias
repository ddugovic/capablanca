alias

Usage: alias [word [string]]

  Sets up a command alias so that "word" is equivalent to typing "string".  If
"string" is omitted then the current value of "word" is displayed.  If both
parameters are omitted, then all of your aliases are displayed.

  "alias"             -- lists all of your aliases
  "alias word"        -- gives your alias for "word"
  "alias word string" -- creates/updates an alias for you so that typing
                         "word" is equivalent to typing "string"

  Use the "unalias" command to remove an alias.

SYSTEM ALIASES

  There are many system aliases that everyone has by default; you do not need
to set them up, they are already there.  Here is the list:

     a             accept                .             tell .
     bye           quit                  ,             tell ,
     cls           help cls              !             shout
     exit          quit                  :             it
     f             finger                ?             help
     go            goboard               *             kibitz
     goto          goboard               +             addlist
     hi            history               -             sublist
     logout        quit                  #             whisper
     m             match
     more          next
     p             who a
     players       who a
     re            refresh
     saa           simallabort
     sab           simabort
     sadj          simadjourn
     saadj         simalladjourn
     sh            shout
     sn            simnext
     sp            simprev
     t             tell                 
     v             variables                  
     vars          variables                  
     w             who
     znotl         znotify

  Other system aliases are added from time to time.  The help files for the
different commands will have the most updated information.

WARNING:

  Becareful to avoid using an alias that can also stand for another command on
the server.  For example, "fg" could be a chess move (for f-pawn X g-pawn), so
don't have "fg" be an alias.  For similar reasons, don't use "t" as an alias
since it is already assigned as an alias for "tell".  For example, avoid using
"hi" to mean not "history" but something else, like "tell @ Hello there.  How
are you?"  If you later "unalias" your "hi" alias, the "hi" system alias for
"history" may not come back automatically.

SPECIAL NOTES:

  (1) Aliases can use the "@" wildcard symbol and thus save you a lot of
typing for routine statements or requests.  For example, using the "mb" alias,
you would type "mb Shane" and have the same request sent as if you had typed
"match Shane 5 12".

  (2) Aliases are not transitive. This sequence of commands ...
    
    alias foo bar
    alias bar baz
    
... will NOT result in "foo" being equivalent to "baz".

  (3) Because of #3, use the full spelling of a command, not an abbreviation,
when creating an alias.  This procedure also ensures that the alias will work
properly.

  (4) You may not create an alias for the quit command.
