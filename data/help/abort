abort

Usage: abort

  The "abort" request is used in two situations during a chess game.

  (1) You wish to abort the game for some reason.  "Abort" sends a request to
your opponent that your game be aborted.  Your opponent can accept or decline
your offer.  If a proposal to abort has been sent to you, then typing "abort"
(or "accept") will accept the offer.

  (2) Your opponent has run out of time and you believe that a problem has
occured with the connection to the chess server.  Rather than "flag" your
opponent and claim a win on time, you can "abort" the game.  (This function is
the old "courtesyabort" command just made easier to use.)  If you are both out
of time, however, (a) the abort command will be sent as a request, but (b) you
can "flag" and the result will be a draw.

  An aborted game is canceled; no changes in ratings occur, the game is not
stored, and it is not listed in history or counted as a completed game in your
statistics.
